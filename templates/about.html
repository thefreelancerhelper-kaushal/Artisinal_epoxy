                <h2>Our Story</h2>
                <p class="lead">Established in 2019, Nova Scotia Epoxy Flooring was founded on a simple principle: deliver exceptional quality and craftsmanship that stands the test of time.</p>
                
                <p>What started as a passion for transforming ordinary concrete into stunning, durable surfaces has grown into Nova Scotia's premier epoxy flooring company. We've completed hundreds of residential and commercial projects, each one reflecting our commitment to excellence.</p>
                
                <p>We believe that your floors deserve the best. That's why we exclusively use premium Soprema epoxy systems paired with ALSAN pigments to create finishes that are not only beautiful but built to last decades.</p>
